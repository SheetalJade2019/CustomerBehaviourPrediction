# CustomerBehaviourPrediction
using Machine Learning and Python


Introduction :

Customer Behaviour Prediction is process of identifying common behaviour among the group of customers. It is used to retain valued customers as retaining current customer of organization is cheaper as compared to attracting new customers. It helps in inding how customer spends their time on online shopping websites, how much time it spends on searching for items, most frequent items bought, quantity of items bought.

Motivation :

Nowadays people are very busy. They don't have time to go to shop. So, Customers are approaching towards online shopping. Online shopping has become the third most popular Internet activity, following email using/instant messaging and web browsing. The main reason to work on customer behaviour prediction is Consumer-retailer relationship structure is dependent on understanding consumer behaviour in online environments.So, Customer behaviour prediction has gained attention to improve sell of products. It is influenced by many external and internal factors, but the company can also influence the final process of buyer decision-making significantly by its activities.
