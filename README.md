# CustomerBehaviourPrediction
using Machine Learning and Python


Introduction :



Customer Behaviour Prediction is process of identifying common behaviour among the group of customers. It is used to retain valued customers as retaining current customer of organization is cheaper as compared to attracting new customers. It helps in inding how customer spends their time on online shopping websites, how much time it spends on searching for items, most frequent items bought, quantity of items bought.


Motivation :


Nowadays people are very busy. They don't have time to go to shop. So, Customers are approaching towards online shopping. Online shopping has become the third most popular Internet activity, following email using/instant messaging and web browsing. The main reason to work on customer behaviour prediction is Consumer-retailer relationship structure is dependent on understanding consumer behaviour in online environments.So, Customer behaviour prediction has gained attention to improve sell of products. It is influenced by many external and internal factors, but the company can also influence the final process of buyer decision-making significantly by its activities.

Conclusion :



To conclude with the analysis, we have understood that customers purchase chances are more if Bounce Rate is below 0.050 and exit
Rate below 0.075.

The Chances of product purchase is high if ProductRelated Duration is between 0-30000 seconds and ProductRelated pages are between
0-300.

During data analysis, we observed that customers have preferred Operating System 1,2,3,4 is most frequently used in all region.

Browser 2 is used by many customers.

Finally, we understood that online purchasing must be emphasized and improved more among New customers (Type 0) and other (Type 1)
customers whereas the use of promo codes must be emphasized with both Visitor Types.



Future Scope :



Suggesting promotional tools for improving the sales profit.

Predicting which products the customer buy most and providing marketing strategies for improving the sales.
